Atomination

"This game revolves around placing atoms on a grid-based game board. Each grid space has a limit of how
many atoms it can contain. Once the limit is reached, the atoms will expand to the adjacent grid spaces. This
simple rule exhibits an interesting property where chains can be triggered by a single placement. This acts as
a mechanism to capture other grid spaces from your opponents."

This game is incomplete. The trigger does not work as intended.
